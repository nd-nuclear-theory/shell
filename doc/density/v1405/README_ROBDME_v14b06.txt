mfdn.statrobdme.seq###.2J##.p#.n##.2T##  
  static (same initial and final state) reduced OBDMEs 
  (parity-preserving only -- the Hamiltonians we're using preserve parity)
mfdn.rppobdme.seq###.2J##.p#.n##.2T##.seq###.2J##.p#.n##.2T##
  parity-preserving reduced transition OBDMEs 
mfdn.rpcobdme.seq###.2J##.p#.n##.2T##.seq###.2J##.p#.n##.2T##
  parity-changing reduced transition OBDMEs 

labels
  seq### -- overall sequence number of the state in the run
  2J##   -- twice the J-value of the state
  p#     -- parity: 0 = natural parity, 1 = unnatural parity
  n##    -- sequence number for states with the same spin-parity
  2T##   -- twice the T-value of the state

(* I do now realize that this choice is unfortunate since rpc could
also be interpreted as reduced parity-conserving, which is NOT what it
stands for... Anyways, the parity-changing OBDMEs are only calculated
if delta_Nmax = 1 and both parities are calculated in the same run,
which is generally not recommended.  I don't think I have actually
used the parity-changing OBDMEs for any post-processing runs... *)

description of sample output:

 21 -- number of single-particle orbitals, in this case 6 HO shells:
    0s1/2, 0p1/2, 0p3/2, 1s1/2, 0d3/2, 0d5/2, 1p1/2, 1p3/2, 0f5/2, 0f7/2,
    2s1/2, 1d3/2, 1d5/2, 0g7/2, 0g9/2, 2p1/2, 2p3/2, 1f5/2, 1f7/2, 0h9/2, 0h11/2

  2 -- upper limit on K in  [c_a^\dagger \tilde{c}_b]_K    (input parameter)
   (* K = 2 is sufficient for M1 and E2 observables, but if one wants the
   complete ROBDMEs, I think one would need to include up to K = 2 j_max, 
   where j_max is the highest j-value for a single-particle orbital,
   i.e. K = 11 for the sample under consideration.  However, I am not
   sure whether in that case the use of the reduced OBDMEs is indeed
   more efficient than the M-dependent OBDMEs *)

315 -- number of ROBDMEs for each type of nucleons (i.e. proton and neutron)

followed by a list of all (315, in this case) labels for the ROBDMEs:

   index,   na, la, 2ja,   nb, lb, 2jb,   K, delta_p

The index is there only for 'book-keeping' purposes.

The set of numbers (n, l, 2j) refer to the quantum numbers.

The ordering that I seem to follow is first all K = 0 ROBDMEs,
then all K = 1 ROBDMEs, etc., up to all K = K_max.   

Note that delta_p is (or should be) 0 for the parity-preserving ROBMDEs, 
and I suspect will be 1 for the parity-changing ROBDMEs.

description of sample output:
            3            3	number of protons, number or neutrons
            2 = 2 M_j    2 = 2J##     0 = p#       1 = n#       0 = 2T##

          315          315      number of ROBDMEs for protons and for neutrons
 
followed by 315 proton ROBDMEs (in the same order as the labels in 
the 'mfdn.rppobdme.info' file, from left to right, 
so the 2nd ROBDME is 7.5273493770880148E-2, 
the 3rd OBDME is 3.3813896180288718E-2, 
the 4th OBDME is 9.8182894752409808E-2, etc.),

followed by 315 neutron ROBDMEs (in the same order as the labels in the 'info' file)

(* I am aware that for the static ROBDMEs I only need one set of
quantum numbers to describe the state, and have to admit I'm not sure
if it makes any sense to duplicate that line...  
I am also aware that the same info is also given in the filename.
Furthermore, in practice, the number or ROBDMEs is the same for
protons and neutrons, though that will not be the case in version15,
which is what I am currently working on *)
