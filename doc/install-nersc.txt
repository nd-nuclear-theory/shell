shell project installation -- summary for NERSC Edison/Cori

Please see install.txt for the general discussion of installation.
This file just provides the quick reference summary for NERSC Edison.

10/28/16 (mac): Created.
10/29/16 (mac): Updated with pjf's Intel compilation fix.
10/31/16 (mac): Update for Cori.

----------------------------------------------------------------

1) Retrieving source

Change to the directory where you want the repository to be installed,
e.g.,

  % cd ~/projects

Clone the shell repository and all submodules.  You will be asked for
your ND netid password several times.  In the following, replace "netid" with your ND NetID.

  % git clone --recursive ssh://netid@crcfe01.crc.nd.edu/afs/crc.nd.edu/group/nuclthy/git/shell.git

Then change to the shell project directory for all the following
steps:

  % cd shell

Workaround: If the process hangs, kill with Ctrl-C, clean up with "rm
-rf shell", and try again.  If it keeps hanging, split up the
process...

  % git clone ssh://netid@crcfe01.crc.nd.edu/afs/crc.nd.edu/group/nuclthy/git/shell.git
  % cd shell
  % submodule init
  % submodule update

and repeat submodule update until all submodules have been successfully cloned.

1') Subsequently updating source

  % git pull
  % git submodule update

2) Compiler

   You can use the default intel compiler suite, or you can compile
   under gnu.  See the build instructions below for the correct
   modules to load.

3) Libraries

   Boost and GSL already installed on Edison and Cori.  See the build
   instructions below for the correct modules to load.

   The Eigen library is a template library (no compiled binaries).
   Although it is installed as a module on Edison, the installation
   tends to lag, and it is missing from Cori (10/31/16).  So it is
   better to use our own private copy, in the m2032 project space.
   The environment variable EIGEN_DIR should be set to point to the
   parent directory of a tree which looks like
   "include/eigen3/Eigen/<headers>".  See the build instructions below
   for the correct setenv invocation.

4) Makefile configuration

   You need to create a symbolic link "config.mk" to point to the
   correct configuration file.  You can use the predefined
   configuration files in shell/config.

   For compiling under gcc, you should be able to use:

   % ln -s config/config-gcc-craype.mk config.mk

   For compiling under intel, you should be able to use:

   % ln -s config/config-intel-craype.mk config.mk

   It is important to use these "...-craype.mk" config files, since
   they configure make to invoke the correct Cray Programming
   Environment compiler wrapper "CC", which has the correct settings
   to generate executables for the compute nodes, instead of invoking
   the generic "g++" or "icpc".

5) Build

   If you prefer to switch from the intel compiler to the gnu
   compiler:

   % module swap PrgEnv-intel PrgEnv-gnu

   Even if using the intel compiler suite, loading GCC 4.8+ (for C++11
   compatibility) is still required, since gcc is used internally by
   icpc:

   % module load gcc

   You will also need to load modules to access the above libraries:

   % module load boost
   % module load gsl

   And point to the Eigen library in our group space:

   % setenv EIGEN3_DIR /global/project/projectdirs/m2032/opt/eigen-3.2.10

   As a shortcut, the module load instructions (and setenv) have all
   been saved to a file in the config directory:

   % source config/module-load-nersc-edison.csh

   Then for the actual build (parallel make with -j option is
   recommended):

   % make all -j8

6) Sanity check:

   % cd programs/h2utils
   % ./h2stat
   % ./h2stat --verify test/test-tb-2.dat

   You should see something like the following output:

      h2stat  -- MFDn H2 file statistics
      
      Input stream
        File: test/test-tb-2.dat
        Format: 0 (text)
        Orbitals: p 6 n 6 (oscillator-like true)
        Truncation: p 2.0000 n 2.0000 pp 2.0000 nn 2.0000 pn 2.0000
        Sectors: pp 7 nn 7 pn 7 => total 21
        Matrix elements: pp 32 nn 32 pn 110 => total 174

Notes:

10/28/16 (mac): For reference, we note that the following are the
   current default versions on Edison as of 10/29/16:

   % module load gcc/6.1.0
   % module load boost/1.54
   % module load gsl/1.16
   % module load eigen3/3.2.0 

Note: This is a pretty old version of eigen which gives lots of
warnings under gcc.

Successful build with gnu (PrgEnv-gnu => gcc/6.1.0).  Failing build
with intel (PrgEnv-intel => intel/15.0.1.133).

10/29/16 (pjf e-mail): I just found a particularly nasty interaction
between compilers on NERSC. It appears that, internally, icpc calls
gcc. The simple answer is, you need to have at least GCC 4.8
loaded. Call 'module load gcc/4.8.0' or higher (the default 6.1.0 is
preferred). It's probably a good idea to call 'module load
intel/16.0.0.109' or 'module load intel/17.0.0.098' to get a newer
version of icpc too.

10/31/16 (mac): Successful builds on Cori with gcc and intel:

   PrgEnv-gnu/6.0.3 => gcc/5.3.0 
   gcc/5.3.0
   boost/1.61
   gsl/2.1
   m2032/opt/eigen-3.2.10

   PrgEnv-intel/6.0.3 => intel/16.0.3.210
   gcc/5.3.0
   boost/1.61
   gsl/2.1
   m2032/opt/eigen-3.2.10
