* identity: identity operator (scalar)

    generated with h2mixer

* interaction: interaction files at very low truncation (scalar)

    - coulomb (hw=20 MeV)

    - JISP16 (hw=20 MeV)

* quadrupole: quadrupole operator (nonscalar)

  - quadrupole_Nmax06_total_h2v15099.{dat,bin}: isoscalar (mass) quadrupole
    operator, for oscillator length b=1

    obtained by Moshinsky transformation from quadrupole_Nmax06_total_rel.dat

* zero: matrix element files with all zero entries, but obeying various
  multipole selection rules (scalar and nonscalar)

    generated with h2mixer (with no input matrix elements)
