
runmfdn01: harmonic oscillator direct run, i.e., with interaction
tbmes given directly at hw

    4He Nmax02 hw20 (direct)

    Interaction: run0164-JISP16-tb-10

    Usage: qsubm --here mfdn02

    We use tb-10 as the smallest available set of files.

runmfdn02: same harmonic oscillator run, but with trivial identity
dilation

    4He Nmax02 hw20 (direct)

    Interaction: run0164-JISP16-tb-10

    Usage: qsubm --here mfdn02

    We use tb-10 as the smallest available set of files, though more
    commonly files in ob truncation would be used for such a
    dilation.

runmfdn03: same harmonic oscillator run, but with dilation from
hw_int=40 (at ob-13 truncation)

    4He Nmax02 hw20  (from hwint=40 at ob-13)

    Interaction: run0164-JISP16-ob-13

    Usage: qsubm --here mfdn03

runmfdn04: harmonic oscillator direct run, at higher Nmax

    4He Nmax16 hw20

    Interaction: run0164-JISP16-tb-20

    Usage: qsubm --here mfdn04

        or qsubm --here mfdn04 --depth=6 --nodesize=64   # for OMP parallel on front end
