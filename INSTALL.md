# Installation instructions for shell #

This repository includes submodules, so be sure to do a recursive clone:

  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  % git clone --recursive https://github.com/nd-nuclear-theory/shell.git
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You will also need a suitable config.mk file.  Most likely you will want to
clone the ndconfig repository, if you do not already have it:

  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  % git clone https://github.com/nd-nuclear-theory/ndconfig.git
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is where you will also find the full installation instructions
("Installation instructions for ND nuclear theory projects using `ndconfig`") in
`ndconfig/INSTALL.md`.
