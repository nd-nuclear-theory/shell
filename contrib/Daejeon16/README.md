IMPORTANT NOTICE:
Please note, there was a mistake in the previous version of the
fortran file, Daejeon16_public_v1.f90, which provided all
matrix elements multiplied by the factor of 25.
Use the current version, the file Daejeon16_public_v2.f90,
where this bug is corrected and which works much faster.

Description

The FORTRAN file Daejeon16_public_v2.f90 generates Daejeon16 NN interaction
matrix elements in the oscillator basis with hw=25 MeV. See the beginning
of the file Daejeon16_public_v2.f90 for explanations of how to use it.
